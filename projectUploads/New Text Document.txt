---Through the experence of using quts' web technology like HIQ and blackboard we decided to build a web application to improve the current system, so that it is more compateble to other qut services. In order to bilud this system, we have to learn the basic web application programming skills through the whole year. which canbe divided into front-end and back-end developing.

Also as our superviser mentioned before, the current inplace system is very hard to use, not only the functionality but also the userbility. in order to improve that, we had made a disision to use some popular CSS and JAVASCRIPT liberaries such as bootstrape and jquery, obvisely that are the new kind of skills we are going to learn. Aslo during this semester, we are using jira as our project management tool to control our project time line. which Richard is going to talk about in more detail in the next couple minutes. For the back-end developing, we are planning to use nodejs as the server-side launguage. Since we are all new to nodejs, that could be a big chanllenge for us during next semesters implantation.
